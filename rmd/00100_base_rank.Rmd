Numbers can be ordinal,positional (1st, 2nd) or cardinal, quantity (10 > 9)

Ranking sorts by some value; then positions largest as `1st` ;   think of sports ranking.
```{r rank}

# RANK is each element's distance from lowest (smallest) bottom (=1)
# Think:  who is winning? (is first on list)
# 10 is always 3rd from bottom (which is 1 here)
# Rank:  map each element to its position when ranked  (from top)
rank(c(10, 8, 1))  # 3, 2, 1   # item 1 (10) is largest
rank(c(10, 8, 3)) # [1] 3 2 1
rank(c(1,10,8)) # [1] 1 3 2    10 moves to 1st


v  <- c("j", "d", "i")                 # j "largest"; moves to top position
rank(v) # [1] 3 1 2
```



```{r reprex}

# R
#'  **Order vs rank**
                 #'
#'  The function roll() picks 3 letters (from the first 10) and displays results several ways.   
#'
#'  Every now and then order and rank do not match, puzzling me.   
#'



#'  First, the roll function                
    roll  <- function(original = NULL) {
    # if user provides no original, pick sample  of 3

    if (is.null(original))
      original  <- sample(letters[1:10], size=3)

    #  
    list  <- list(original = original, 
                  sort = sort(original),
                  order = order(original),
                  rank = rank(original)
                  )
    }
#' 
#'  # let's try, examine the different ways to present:
    #
    (r  <- roll())
#'

#' Now, try with this specific choice, why do order and rank differ? 
#'
    v  <- c("j", "d", "i")    # rank, from largest( j, i, d) (3, 2, 1) 3=larges
    (r  <- roll(v))
    (r  <- roll())
# $original
# [1] "c" "j" "b"   # in order, b,c,j   j is largest
# 
# $sort
# [1] "b" "c" "j"
# 
# $order
# [1] 3 1 2
# 
# $rank     j is largest, winning (3), c -> 2nd place, b -> 3rd 
# [1] 2 3 1
# 
# 
```
