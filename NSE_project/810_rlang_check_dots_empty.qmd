#### example
```{r}
library(rlang)

f <- function(x, ..., foofy = 8) {
  check_dots_empty()
  x + foofy
}

# This fails because `foofy` can't be matched positionally
try(f(1, 4))

# This fails because `foofy` can't be matched partially by name
try(f(1, foof = 4))

try(f(1,...,4))
# [1] "Error in try(f(1, ..., 4)) : '...' used in an incorrect context\n"

try(f(1,...,foofy = 4))
# [1] "Error in try(f(1, ..., foofy = 4)) : '...' used in an incorrect context\n"

# Thanks to `...`, it must be matched exactly
f(1, foofy = 4)
