## store by "A",  retrieve full contents 
```{r}
A <- B <- C <- 1:4
A;B

# method 1
L = list(A = A, B = B, C = C)
L  # full contents

# method 2
nms = c("A", "B", "C")
nms[[1]]   # "A"

# get contents
sapply(nms, get, simplify=F, USE.NAMES =  TRUE)
```

## now change contents of A
```{r}
A = 10:14


# method 1
L = list(A = A, B = B, C = C)
L  # WRONG !


# method 2
# has new contents of A !  (dynamic)
sapply(nms, get, simplify=F, USE.NAMES =  TRUE)
