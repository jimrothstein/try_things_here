```{r}

library(mosaic)

heartrate  <- read.csv("~/code/try_things_here/STATS/gentle/heartrate.csv")
head(heartrate)
ggplot(heartrate) + 
  geom_point(aes(x=age, y=hrmax)) + 
  geom_smooth(aes(x=age, y=hrmax), method='lm')
``` 

### model:  y = 208 - 0.7*age
```{r}
model_hr = lm(hrmax ~ age, data=heartrate)
summary(model_hr)
coef(model_hr)
# (Intercept)         age 
#     207.931      -0.688 
#  y = 208 - 0.7*age

fitted(model_hr) %>%      # model predictions
   head(5)
```
### residuals
Given 2 ppl, the age accounts for a certain amount of difference; (explained)
But usually not the entire difference, meaning y value not exactly predicted for that age.
Another way: 2 ppl at SAME age have different y values. (unexplained)

```{r}
sd(resid(model_hr))     # unpredicted

sd(predict(model_hr))   # predicted (from age)


library(data.table)
diff  <- data.table(actual = heartrate$hrmax,
                    predicted = fitted(model_hr),
                    predict(model_hr))
diff
```
