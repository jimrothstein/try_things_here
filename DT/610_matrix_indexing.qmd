PURPOSE:		Explain how A[B] can be used to pick out values of A, according to coordinates in each row of B.  A, B matrix

Rmk:

To grep, escape the special char  
grep -EHRn 'A\[B\]'

```

###	Use matrix B to pick off specific elements (row, col) of A
```{r}
#| label: matrix A
#| warning: false
A  <- matrix(1:12, 4)
A
#'      [,1] [,2] [,3]
#' [1,]    1    5    9
#' [2,]    2    6   10
#' [3,]    3    7   11
#' [4,]    4    8   12

```

```{r}
#| label: matrix B 
#| warning: false
B  <- matrix(c(1,3,2,3), 2)
B
#      [,1] [,2]
# [1,]    1    2
# [2,]    3    3

A[B]
# [1]  5 11
#
#	first row of B is (1,2),  find elment of A which these coord (5)
#	second row of B is (3,3) find element of A which corres (11)
#
#
####	Sublety   
###Consider A[i  as a mapping.  i is row of B, and the mapping returns
###value of A with those coordinates.
```
