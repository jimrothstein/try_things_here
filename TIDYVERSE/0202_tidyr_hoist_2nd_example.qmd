PURPOSE:  tidyr::hoist to extract from ROWS in list-column, slightly more complex
-   df now has 3rd (fake) list added to  orginal 
-   study how names in this 3rd named list affect hoist output!
-   This example reveals much of hoist.

```{r}
library(tidyr)

df <- tibble(
  character = c("Toothless", "Dory", "Fake"),
  metadata = list(
    list(
      species = "dragon",
      color = "black",
      films = c(
        "How to Train Your Dragon",
        "How to Train Your Dragon 2",
        "How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World"
      )
    ),
    list(
      species = "blue tang",
      color = "blue",
      films = c("Finding Nemo", "Finding Dory")
    ),
    ## add 3rd fake list        
    list( species = "fake1",     -- change to `A` and hoist ignores
          B  = "fake2",
          films = c("fake3",     --  change to `C`  ...
                "fake4"
            )
  )
))

df

##  Compare films
    str(df)
    str(df, vec.len =1 )    ## examine `films` entry
    str(df, list.len=2)     ## change list.len = 3


# Extract only specified components
z = (df %>% hoist(metadata,
  "species",
  first_film = list("films", 1L),   ## 1st films entry in EACH list
  third_film = list("films", 3L)    ## 3rd entry, if any
))
z
str(z)              ## examine:  most of new fake list, put in metadata

dput(z)
```

# structure(list(character = c("Toothless", "Dory", "Fake"), 
species = c("dragon", # "blue tang", "fake1"), 
first_film = c("How to Train Your Dragon", # "Finding Nemo", "fake3"), 
third_film = c("How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World",  NA, NA),
